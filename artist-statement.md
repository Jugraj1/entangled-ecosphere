In "Ecosphere," I invite you to step into a world inspired by the intricate ecosystems found in the game "Rain World." This interactive artwork is a testament to the awe-inspiring beauty and delicate balance of nature, as well as a contemplative exploration of our own role within it.
Whether its the leeches or the ghosts, once they all come over the cat, it is almost impossible for the poor cat to move and eventually the different creatures will feed on the slay cat.
The cat shown in the artwork acts as the user and moves wherever the user's wants it to move. The artwork consists of three scenes. The cat can move onto the next scene by passing through the dark green line shown. The primary keys are used for interaction. That is, 'W' for moving up, 'D' for moving right, 'A' for moving left, 'S' for moving down. The cat tends to fall down automatically after 3 seconds but it can be made manual by using the "S" key with which it falls down instantly. 
Amidst the serene beauty of "Ecosphere," there exists a symbol of rebellion. The leeches in the drainage system into which the cat has fallen try to attack the cat and the cat tries to escape them. The slay cat, struggling against the relentless tide of leeches, represents the resilience of life in the face of adversity. Just as the cat fights back against its attackers, we are reminded of the determination of the natural world to persist and adapt, even when faced with challenges. The leaches follow the slug cat's movement and wait for the movement of the cat to latch on. 
Escaping the leaches, it then enters a new world where the attack is even worse. It encounters the set of ghosts which shoot bullets at the slay cat. Once they accumulate over the slay cat, it becomes very hard for the poor cat to move, eventually leading it die.
Furthermore, the three distinct scenes offer a dynamic progression, each building upon the previous, with the interaction becoming increasingly vital. In the final scene, viewers face a high-energy showdown, where their control over the cat's movement determines its fate in the face of ethereal ghosts and bullets. This heightened level of interaction not only intensifies the emotional connection but also underscores the message of resilience and determination. By immersing yourself in this digital ecosystem, I encourage you to consider your place in the grand tapestry of life and to appreciate the profound wonders of the natural world.
